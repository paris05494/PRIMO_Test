# Merge Sort Project (Without Built-in Sort Function)
TypeScript project that implements a function `merge` to merge and sort three arrays under specific constraints. The project includes unit tests using Jest.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Requirements

The function follows this interface:
```typescript
function merge(collection_1: number[], collection_2: number[], collection_3: number[]): number[];
```
- collection_1 and collection_2 are sorted in ascending order.
- collection_3 is sorted in descending order.
- The function returns a single array sorted in ascending order.
- Do not use any built-in sort functions (.sort()).
